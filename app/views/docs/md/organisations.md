## Creating an organisation

Click Organisations > Create an organisation in the sidebar. Provide the basic details for the organisation and click Save and continue. You will then notice a new dropdown for your organisation containing further admin options at the top of the main window.

## Payments

To accept payments for tickets to events created under the organisation, you must add either Stripe or Coinbase Commerce details to your organisation.

## Mailgun

We offer a free gift of 1 email per month for up to 1000 subscribers. Beyond that, you'll need to link a paid [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) account. (You can always email attendees of events even without linking a Mailgun account.)

## Recognising monthly donors

Provide a GoCardless access token and/or Patreon API key, and people with active subscriptions will be recognised as monthly donors/members of the organisation.

## Activities

Activities are used for bundling families of similar events. To create a new activity, go to the organisation dropdown and click Activities, then Create an activity.

If an activity is marked as application-only, only followers of the activity are able to buy tickets, and people can only become followers by having an application accepted.

## Local groups

To create a new local group, go to the organisation dropdown and click Local groups, then Create a local group.

When people that have provided a location follow your organisation, they are added to all relevant local groups.

The Geometry field of a local group accepts a GeoJSON polygon created via [https://geojson.io/](https://geojson.io/). (Copy and paste the contents of the box on the right.)
